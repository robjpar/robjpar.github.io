            <p><strong>Robert J. Paruch</strong> received his Ph.D. in computational physics at the Jagiellonian
                University in Krakow, Poland. His long-standing research interests are in computer modeling of physical
                phenomena, associated analytical tools software development and data analysis aimed at improving the
                efficiency and productivity of experimental setups. His work experience includes a five-year
                postdoctoral appointment at the Pennsylvania State University, the Department of Chemistry, where his
                research projects focused on modeling of sputtering of materials by energetic particles and building
                analytical models. The results of his research helped in the development of new approaches to
                interpreting computer simulations, as well as optimization of the secondary-ion mass spectrometry
                analytical technique.</p>

            <p>Coauthored over 25 scientific publications as a result of independent and collaborative work within the
                research group, peer-reviewed research publications, and presented the results of research at numerous
                international conferences and workshops.</p>

            <p>In his spare time, he enjoys cooking, sightseeing and photographing.</p>

            <p>Currently attending the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Oregon in order to round out the skills and
                gain the additional experience required to peruse the career opportunities in the industrial workspace.</p>
